## Description  
  
In this repo we store all the code to run ``_printf``,  our version of the function ``printf``. This function replicates some of the processes of the function in the standard library ``stdio.h``.  
  
### Allowed functions  
  
* ``write``, ``malloc``, ``free``, ``va_start``, ``va_end``, ``va_copy``,``va_arg``  
  
## Compilation  
  
``_printf`` was compiled and test using the following comand:  
  
``$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c``  
  
The prototypes to all of the functions we used during the coding process are stored in our header file ``holberton.h``. However to test the program functionalities it is necessary to add a main.c file prior to the compilation process.  
  
## Functions:  
  
Each function has its own description displayed as comments on top of it. You will find as well a manual page with the general use of the function, including the modifiers after the "%" flag.  
  
As general rule for this repository each file contains up to 5 functions, and each function cannot be over 43 lines of code.
