.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR #include

.BR int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function produce standard output according to a

given.
.SH RETURN VALUES
On successful return, the function returns the number of characters printed and excludes the null byte ('\0') at the end of any string.
.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
The
.I format
is a string, and has to be entered as a regular string. The program will print all the ordinary characters different than
.BI %
, once it finds the convertion flag
.BI %
it will convert the next argument of the function based on the modifier after the convertion flag.

.BR _printf("
.I %format
", type);
.SH MODIFIERS
Once the function identifies the flag
.BI %
it will look for a modifier (d,i,c,s), below we explain the usage of each modifier:
.IP -d
The function will print an integer with sign in base 10.
.IP -i
The function will print an integer with sign in base 10.
.IP -c
The function will print the character based on the value stored at the
.I ASCII
table.
.IP -s
The function will print a string excluding the null byte at the end.
.SH EXAMPLE
The programm takes any other character before the flag "%" and prints them, once the flag is determine, the program compares the next char to it and determines what kind of function has to be used.

.IP i.e
The line
.BR _printf("Hello %s", "World")
would print
.BR "Hello World"

In case that the
.I format
does not match any of the options, the program will take it as a regular char and print it.
